suppose, you have to find the largest length of palindrome of an array, we can do this using binary search.

palindromes are two types, odd & even, so we’ll run two binary searches, one for odd and one for even.

the twist is, if we find a palindrome of size 6, for sizes 4 and 2, surely they are palindromes. similar for odd.

for odd, lo is 1, hi will be odd, so be careful.
for odd, if mid is even, –mid.

be careful, jamela ache maybe :3
